# ComputerVision

Computer Vision projects using OpenCV, and Custom made library


1. Edge Detector:  
  - This is a C++ program that is designed to run on the Windows Operating System.
  - This program uses mathematical image processing techniques, such as Gaussian filtering, non-
    maxima suppression, and bilinear interpolation, to first smooth the image, then detect edges in an image and identify the boundaries between different     objects or features in the image
    
2. Road Sign Detector: 
  - This program detects road signs using various functoins from OpenCV
